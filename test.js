1- If you make a change in any file you should make the steps we used to know
like git add, git commit, and then push it into you'r repo.
2- When you finish pushing you'r code, make a pull request, and after I merge it,
make sure that all the files you have on you'r local are the same of the ones 
on the github using this command: git checkout master.
